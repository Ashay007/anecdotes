Justice- Duty to Resist Injustice/Fairness

When Gandhi Ji was thrown out of first-class compartment in South Africa, he was not the first person to have met that treatment. The bad 
man, Britishers were busy torturing good man in the South Africa at that time. Gandhi Ji decided to act against this torture and started a 
movement against racial discrimination in South Africa. He got successful in many aspects. Later, it was Nelson Mandela who took 
active participation to eradicate apartheid. The movement finally culminated in black people getting rights on par with white people
after the eradication of apartheid in South Africa. Good part is that the black people did not throw out the white people from the country, 
rather they decided to stay together and make the nation great.

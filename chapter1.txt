Peace/Forgiveness/Transformation of character

Angulimala was dacoit who used to kill people and used to cut their fingers and made a garland out of those fingers. He used to live on a hill 
top. Once Buddha was passing by that hill. Angulimala got happy and came running to Buddha. He thought that Buddha would be afraid of 
him but instead Buddha was peaceful and quiet, smiling with grace and compassion. This was turning moment for Angulimala. He became 
disciple of Buddha and choose the good path after that. Later after 10 years, when same Angulimala returned to the village in which he had 
killed many people but this time as a saint, villagers started pelting stones on him, feeling the hatred they had for him. But he was quiet and 
peaceful just like Buddha, smiling with grace and compassion. Such gesture moved the villagers and then they also became disciples of 
Angulimala.
Hence, we may face adversity in life but what matters is how we respond to it. We can choose to be peaceful & forgiving in any situation. We may 
respond like Buddha and the saint Angulimala.
